# opioid-regulations
Since 1999, the U.S. has experienced a tremendous increase in the abuse of opioids for two
decades. The continuing abuse of opioid prescriptions led to a 6% increase in the opioid-related
death rate and an increased death rate from non-opioids drugs such as Heroin. To reduce opioid
abuse, several states launched opioid regulation laws during the last decade. In this project, we
are interested in examining if such regulations effectively reduce the opioids prescriptions in
those states. In addition, we are also interested in the effect of opioid regulation laws on the
mortality rate resulting from drug overdose.
If the result of our study shows that state regulations on opioids do reduce the opioid
prescriptions and mortality rate, we can conclude that there is a positive effect of those
regulations and we should recommend states that have not implemented opioid regulations to
implement similar policies.
